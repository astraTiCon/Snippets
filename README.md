# Usage

Nodes can be **added** by selecting a node, and entering the name for the node to be created in the box below the remove button. If the node should not have a direct parent, then type `NodeName,root` instead.

The **remove** button will remove the last selected node. If said Node has any children, they will be added to the parent node.

Hitting **save** will save the contents of the large text area in a file with the name of the last selected node.
