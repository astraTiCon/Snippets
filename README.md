# Snippets
Program for storing notes

![](https://github.com/astraTiCon/Snippets/blob/master/SnippetsUI.PNG)

# Usage

Nodes can be added by selecting a node, and entering the name for the node to be created in the box below the remove button. If the node should not have a direct parent, then type "NodeName,root" instead.

The remove button will remove the last selected node. If said Node has any children, they will be added to the parent node.

Hitting save will save the contents of the large text area in a file with the name of the last selected node.


# Running it

Clone it `git clone https://github.com/astraTiCon/Snippets.git`

Open and run in IntelliJ IDEA, no dependencies required except Java.


*NB: I will update the project soon to include an executable.*
